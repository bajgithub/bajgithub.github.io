                It is no grand statement to say that the modern world runs on the internet, but the modern life runs on the internet now as well. For decades now, livelihoods and lives have migrated to and been consumed by this digitally interconnected world. Starting with a small network of interconnected computers, the web quickly expanded in the 90s. Before the days of major social media platforms as we know them today, there was no structure to how you put yourself online — no predefined profiles, posts, or pictures. If you wanted one, you had to make your own.
            <p class="univers-45-light">
                Personal webpages certainly do exist today, but they are relegated to the periphery given the titanic presence of modern social media giants. Given the mighty team of exactly one person working on a personal webpage, they also tend to pale in comparison to the vivd clutter of social media platforms. Personal pages tend to take on a far more simple style, reminiscent of the dial-up days of the internet. Therefore, in my vernacular, this style of webpage has taken on the name "Web 1.0 Page". While a social media site may offer an inclusive sinkhole for all, the personal webpage is a simple, cozy representation of one's interests. It possesses none of the vanity of modern social media, but serves as an even better reflection of a person themselves. 
            <p class="univers-45-light">
                Some of these site no longer have owners. Some of these people, who put their passions and interests out into the world in basic html, have died after curating their site for many years. The stale pages serve almost as a public epitaph to their creator — written in ink until the page vanishes.
            <p class="univers-45-light">
                Given the number of "Web 1.0 Pages" I've run across and enjoyed perusing, I've decided to make one of my own here. I don't know exactly what purpose it may serve; it could be anywhere from thoughts and philosophies to actual researched stories, but we'll see. Part of the fun of this is not knowing where it might wind up or who may be reading this at any given time. They may be like me going through all of the sites I have seen — suddenly struck with sonder after pouring through the pages of my life. However, the site isn't dedicated to pleasing the people who stumble across it, rather, my "Web 1.0" page will simply serve at my pleasure.
