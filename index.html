            <p class="univers-45-light">
                I'm Blake Johnson, a 23 year-old Aerospace Engineering Graduate, now a student getting my Master's in Mechanical Engineering with an interest in anything that is mechanical or old. I always enjoy keeping myself engaged with a project or something else to enrich and expand my knowledge base; which is, in part, why I decided to make this originally as portfolio site (another reason is to avoid resorting to ridiculously small font sizes on my resume). Now this has branched into a site for some musings as well, so I've haphazardly combined the two and you can go down the rabbit hole that you please.
            <p class="univers-45-light">
                Some of my portfolio is still a work in progress, both in in terms of web development and rounding up all of the projects (and their respective descriptions and photos) I have done in my time as an undergrad; all I ask for is a little mercy and patience.
