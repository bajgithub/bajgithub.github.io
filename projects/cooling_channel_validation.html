                Since the creation of the Nephas engine project at SEDS at UCSD, regenerative cooling channels were integral to the design. The cooling channels serve not only as a means to cool the engine, but also modifying the state of the liquid CH4 for proper injection as a gas. By researching other channels and processing test geometries through NASA software (ONC, TDK, RTE), I was able to find optimal channel designs for Nephas. However, numerical values output by a computer are not enough to validate a design. So, I created the above model with two cooling channel designs to test their real performance. This was then 3D printed with the same materials and in the identical orientation as Nephas, so the results from a cold-flow test would be meaningful.

                After flowing both channels with LNG on SEDS Colossus Test Stand, one of the channels was selected for use on the final engine. It was chosen for its moderate pressure drop and its similar geometry to other designs on similar engines (which gives us further assurance as to the soundness of our selected regenerative cooling channels design). The Nephas engine is currently being printed with this channel design and will be hotfired in Winter 2024.
