                Since the creation of the Nephas engine project at SEDS at UCSD, regenerative cooling channels were integral to the design. The cooling channels serve not only as a means to cool the engine, but also modifying the state of the liquid CH4 for proper injection as a gas. By researching other channels and processing test geometries through NASA software (ONC, TDK, RTE), I was able to find optimal channel designs for Nephas. However, numerical values output by a computer are not enough to validate a design. So, I created the above model with two cooling channel designs to test their real performance. This was then 3D printed with the same materials and in the identical orientation as Nephas, so the results from a cold-flow test would be meaningful.
