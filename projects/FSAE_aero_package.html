                To design the Aero Package for our FSAE car, the Aero team first started with a high-level overview of our goals. As always, we wanted to improve upon the previous year's design by increasing the effective downforce, reducing the amount of drag, and increasing the durability of the package to withstand testing, transport, and competition. With contributions with just a few individuals, all of the goals. The front of the aero package was improved upon by selecting better airfoils and an arrangement that would satisfy our objectives. The undertray was also improved by increasing its durability; in previous years the undertray would degrade severely due to debris. Lastly, the rear aero package was improved by not only by a better airfoil selection, but also by adding the ability to adjust the angles of attack of each airfoil. The full aero package was simulated in a 2D Ansys Fluent simulation.

                The package was tested by running our car in a traction circle with increasing speed until the grip limit of the tire was exceeded. There was a marked improvement in the ability of the car to handle with the new aero package, validating the results of the simulation. Additionally, our design's effectiveness was further proven by our 4th Place in our FSAE competition and was durable enough to continue testing post-competition.
