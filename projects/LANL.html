            <p class="univers-45-light">
                During the summer of 2025, I had the opportunity to work as a research fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico. This experience was invaluable, allowing me to apply my engineering skills in a real-world research environment.
            <p class="univers-45-light">
                Under the LADSS Program, teams of three students were assigned to work on various projects. My team performed research under MPA-11 (Materials Physics and Applications) to develop a novel method for water clarification using ultrasonic waves. An ultrasonic transducer (that is positioned in a chamber to create a standing wave) is driven in silt-laiden water, which, from acoustic radiation forces, causes the silt to clump together and fall out of their suspended place in the water. This method is a promising alternative to traditional filtration methods, as it is more energy-efficient and has fewer modes for failure than traditional systems.
            <p class="univers-45-light">
                The results of our research were very promising, and we will be presenting and publishing our findings at IMAC 2026.
