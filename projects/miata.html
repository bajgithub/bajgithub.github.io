                Now a victim of garage space and enjoying its life now with a friend of mine, I enjoyed working on my Miata and it will always hold a place in my heart.
            <p class="univers-45-light">
                I've done a full engine and transmission pull (and the hard part, putting them back in). I took the time and replaced nearly every seal on the engine and transmission. In addition, I replaced the water pump, power steering pump, timing belt, idlers, and a full cooling system refresh. I also did a refresh of the entire suspension system, installed a new softtop, and modified the wiring harness to include headrest speakers.
