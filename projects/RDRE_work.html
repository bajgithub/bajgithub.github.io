            <p class="univers-45-light">
                As a part of SEDS at UCSD, I am leading research into creating a Rotating Detonation Rocket Engine (RDRE) in an effort to maximize the efficiency of our propulsion system for use on future rockets to be developed by SEDS. Ideally, the RDRE should match the thrust (2000lbf) and the diameter of the current engine SEDS utilizes, Nephas. This would maximize the compatibility of the RDRE engine with existing and future rockets, by, at least, creating a geometric standard, but also establishing theorical parameters by which to design future rockets by.

            <p class="univers-45-light">
                Current research is investigating the fickle start-up present with RDRE designs. Once this is throughly investigated, preliminary design will be begin. The project is affectionately known by "Roto-Detphas", in reference to the current SEDS engine, Nephas.
