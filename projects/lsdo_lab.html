            <p class="univers-45-light">
                In Spring of 2024, during my final year as an undergrad, I accepted a position in the Large-Scale Design Optimization (LSDO) Lab, lead by Dr. John Hwang, at UCSD. The LSDO Lab work specializes in the development and application of numerical optimization algorithms to assist in the design of complex engineering systems. We focus on larger-scale design optimization problems, which involves optimizing systems with hundreds to thousands of design variables across multiple engineering disciplines. Our research advances mathematical methods, algorithms, and software to tackle high-dimensional problems, with a particular emphasis on aerospace vehicle design and urban air mobility. We also collaborate on emerging applications like medical robotics and lead a NASA-funded project on advanced urban air mobility vehicle concepts.

                My work, which will lead into my master's thesis, involves implementing reduced-order modeling (ROM) algorithms into the larger optimization algorithms to improve computational efficiency and eventually expand the number of simultaneous optimizations that can occur.
