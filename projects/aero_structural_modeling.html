            <p class="univers-45-light">
                In this project, I performed a comprehensive structural analysis of an aircraft wing, starting with the calculation of the aircraft's weight and center of gravity (CG). Using the component weights and station locations, I determined the total aircraft weight and CG for various configurations. Following this, I utilized the maximum weight to develop a V-n diagram and gust diamond, identifying critical load cases at sea level. I analyzed the wing loads, maneuvering loads, and required engine power for these load cases, which included steady level flight and the four corners of the V-n diagram and gust diamond.

                Subsequently, I extended the analysis to higher altitudes, repeating the calculations for critical speeds and load factors while accounting for changes in air density. I also calculated the required horsepower and engine performance at altitude, recognizing the effects of altitude on engine efficiency. Finally, I plotted the distributed aerodynamic loads on the wing for a Positive High Angle of Attack (PHAA) flight condition, showcasing how the wing's weight, lift, drag, and moments varied across the span, and compared different load distributions with the ailerons commanded to a 20 degree deflection angle. Through this study, I evaluated the structural and aerodynamic performance of the wing under varying conditions.

            <p class="univers-45-light"></p>
                In this aero-structural modeling project, in MATLAB I analyzed a simplified uniform wing subjected to one-dimensional aerodynamic and in-flight maneuvering loads. The wing features a symmetric cross-section with up to four stringers, uniquely composed of metallic or composite materials. These stringers are placed at the leading and trailing edges, with two symmetrically aligned along the chord-line. The aerodynamic loads, including lift, drag, and a constant twisting moment, are modeled as polynomials, while a distributed wing weight acts along the mid-chord. Through this project, I calculated critical structural properties, such as the shear center, torsion constant, internal load distribution, stringer stress and safety margins, as well as the wing's displacement and twist distributions.

                In a subsequent analytical study, I performed a preliminary structural analysis on a single-cell wing with a length of 240 inches and a chord of 48 inches. Focusing on both aluminum and composite wing designs, I examined the cruise condition and the four corners of the V-n diagram. Using MATLAB, I determined the minimum stringer cross-section area and skin thickness for each design to assess potential weight savings. The study was constrained to maintain symmetric cross-sections, ensuring the properties of opposing stringers and skins were identical, optimizing for effective structural performance while adhering to the symmetry requirements.
