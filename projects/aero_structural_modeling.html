                In this aero-structural modeling project, in MATLAB I analyzed a simplified uniform wing subjected to one-dimensional aerodynamic and in-flight maneuvering loads. The wing features a symmetric cross-section with up to four stringers, uniquely composed of metallic or composite materials. These stringers are placed at the leading and trailing edges, with two symmetrically aligned along the chord-line. The aerodynamic loads, including lift, drag, and a constant twisting moment, are modeled as polynomials, while a distributed wing weight acts along the mid-chord. Through this project, I calculated critical structural properties, such as the shear center, torsion constant, internal load distribution, stringer stress and safety margins, as well as the wing's displacement and twist distributions.

                In a subsequent analytical study, I performed a preliminary structural analysis on a single-cell wing with a length of 240 inches and a chord of 48 inches. Focusing on both aluminum and composite wing designs, I examined the cruise condition and the four corners of the V-n diagram. Using MATLAB, I determined the minimum stringer cross-section area and skin thickness for each design to assess potential weight savings. The study was constrained to maintain symmetric cross-sections, ensuring the properties of opposing stringers and skins were identical, optimizing for effective structural performance while adhering to the symmetry requirements.
