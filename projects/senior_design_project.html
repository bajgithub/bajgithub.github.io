            <p class="univers-45-light">
                In this aerospace engineering design project, my team and I focused on designing, building, and flying a remote-controlled aircraft that could maximize the flight score while balancing weight and efficiency. Alongside contributing to the design and manufacturing, I developed a custom-coded program that optimized the aircraft's sizing based on the competition's scoring function. This program enabled us to fine-tune key parameters, improving overall performance and efficiency. Additionally, I designed a novel method for securing payload syringes without using glue, which not only streamlined the assembly process but also enhanced the aircraft's structural rigidity.

                Throughout the design process, we meticulously analyzed propulsion systems, aerodynamics, performance, and weight distribution. We utilized a range of tools and methods to ensure that the aircraft met both unloaded and payload-carrying conditions efficiently. Our efforts culminated in securing first place in overall flight score and achieving the best payload-to-weight ratio, demonstrating the strength of our design approach. By combining innovative structural solutions with optimized sizing, we achieved top results in the competition.
