                This is the blog side of my website, where I post some musings and thoughts. My goal is to keep it more to the philosophical side of things, rather than strongly researched articles; by all means, I would love to go deep into well-researched topics, but unfortunately I just don't have time to do that at this current juncture. This will also help me post more often as I can dedicate less time to a blurb that comes from within rather than collecting things from without.

                I at least always want to post more often that I actually do...
