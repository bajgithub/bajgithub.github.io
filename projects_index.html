                This is the portfolio side of my website, where I document some of the work I have done through internships, school, or personal projects. I spend many years working in rocketry and car design through UCSD's SEDS and FSAE teams respectively, so you'll see a good number of projects done through and centered around those subjects. In my other projects which are of greater depth, I have focused on making the complex, simple and optimally efficient.
            <p class="univers-45-light">
                Some of my portfolio is still a work in progress, both in in terms of web development and rounding up all of the projects (and their respective descriptions and photos) I have done in my time as an undergrad; all I ask for is a little mercy and patience. I would also like to add a photo album side to this side of the website so I can display pictures from these projects as (buying into the platitude) a picture is worth a thousand words. Stay tuned for whenever I actually get enough free time to do something like that, because I already have a million projects I would like to get started on, but it seems that grad school truly is the time sink people make it out to be.
